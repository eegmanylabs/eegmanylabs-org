# Replications

At the heart of \#EEGManyLabs is the coordinated replication of 27 influential EEG studies selected for their impact on the field. Each experiment is conducted across multiple laboratories (minimum of 3 per replication) using a Registered Report protocol. This approach is delivering high statistical power, offering the field its most comprehensive test of replicability to date. The project is not only revisiting foundational findings but in doing so, is helping to establish best practices for future experimental and analytic standards in EEG research.
