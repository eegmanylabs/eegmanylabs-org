## A large-scale, international effort replicating influential EEG experiments  

\#EEGManyLabs is a large-scale, international collaboration bringing together the global EEG community to strengthen the foundations of cognitive neuroscience. By pooling expertise and resources, our goal is to rigorously assess the replicability of landmark EEG findings. This collective effort is supporting the development of more transparent, reliable science, promoting shared tools, open data, and reproducible methods. Through our inclusive design, #EEGManyLabs is working to build a stronger, more connected research ecosystem committed to the future of EEG.
