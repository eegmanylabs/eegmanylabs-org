# About \#EEGManyLabs

## About EEG

Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most widely used functional neuroimaging modality in the world, featuring in over 5,000 publications annually. Its popularity stems from its unique ability to provide non-invasive, cost-effective, millisecond-level insights into brain activity. In recent years, researchers in engineering and computer science have sought to harness EEG signals beyond the lab—embedding them in wearable and assistive technologies that promise real-world utility.
The potential applications of EEG are vast and potentially transformative. They include Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) for real-time monitoring of cognition and emotion, systems for motor rehabilitation, communication tools for individuals with locked-in syndrome, technologies for augmenting athletic performance, and consumer-grade devices for sleep tracking and mental well-being.
Yet alongside this promise, EEG faces serious challenges: signals are often noisy; datasets small; methods varied; and interpretations inconsistent. These limitations threaten both the replicability of EEG findings and the scalability of its real-world applications.

## Our Mission
\#EEGManyLabs is a large-scale, international collaboration dedicated to addressing these challenges head-on. Our goal is to lay a robust empirical foundation for EEG science—supporting both the advancement of basic neuroscience and the translational impact of EEG technologies.
We do this by:  

- **Replicating Influential Studies:** Conducting high-powered, multi-lab replications of highly cited EEG experiments to evaluate the robustness of foundational findings.  

- **Promoting Open Science:** Sharing data, code, and materials through transparent workflows and open repositories to foster collaboration, accelerate discovery, and democratize access to EEG research.  

## Project Overview
Our current programme includes the replication of more than 20 influential EEG studies, selected through a systematic process based on citation impact and scientific importance.
Each replication involves at least three independent laboratories, increasing statistical power and ensuring generalisability across diverse contexts. All studies are conducted as Registered Reports, with protocols peer-reviewed prior to data collection, to ensure transparency, rigor, and reproducibility.

## Global Collaboration
\#EEGManyLabs is powered by a vibrant and diverse community. Our network includes:  

- Project coordinators and lead labs  

- Advisory board members  

- Over 240 scientists across 40 countries  


We also work closely with aligned initiatives, institutions, and programmes that share our mission of building a more open, reliable, and inclusive EEG science. This project has also inspired multiple new lines of scientific inquiry, spin-offs and collaborations.
