# Spin-offs

The \#EEGManyLabs framework has generated several spin-off projects, each extending the collaborative spirit of the main initiative. These include efforts to celebrate 100 years of EEG, create the largest open dataset of resting-state EEG, automate preprocessing pipelines, explore associations between brain asymmetry and personality, and use prediction markets to estimate replication outcomes. These projects reflect how #EEGManyLabs continues to evolve as a platform for discovery, innovation, and dialogue across diverse strands of EEG science.
