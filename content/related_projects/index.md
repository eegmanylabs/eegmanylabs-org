# Related Projects

The initiative has inspired and contributed to a number of related projects that extend its goals. Some of these efforts have emerged organically from within the #EEGManyLabs community, while others are joint endeavours with external partners and organisations who share our commitment to open, rigorous, and impactful EEG science. These projects span documenting the centenary of EEG, generating large-scale resting-state datasets, advancing automated preprocessing pipelines, and the bringing together key stakeholders across EEG science. Together, they reflect how \#EEGManyLabs serves not only as a platform for replication, but also as a launchpad for broader discovery, infrastructure development, and dialogue across the global neuroscience community.
