This document will serve as a step-by-step guide to walk you through transforming your EEG dataset into one compliant with the BIDS format, using MNE-BIDS.  
Visit the [link](https://github.com/ubdbra001/RosettaState/blob/ed4247448193ba5ca0ffc938c6c96928886d18c9/MNE-BIDS%20pipeline.ipynb) to access our tutorial.

It will walk you through:

- General information  
- Downloading/formatting your dataset  
- Setting up your coding environment  
- Transforming your EEG data to BIDS  
- Adapting your BIDS dataset to include relevant metadata  
- Validating your BIDS dataset  
- Citing MNE-BIDS  
- Adapting the code to iterate through all participants
